    "### Title: Predicting Goal Scoring Totals per Season for Soccer Players\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "This project aims to develop a predictive model that forecasts the number of goals a player is likely to score over a season, leveraging historical performance data, team dynamics, and contextual match factors. Accurately predicting a player's goal total can offer insights into player valuation, transfer potential, and game strategy. The project will focus on data collection, feature engineering, model training, and visualization to highlight key predictors and demonstrate model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description :**\n",
    "This script aims to predict the number of goals scored by a player named Kany over multiple seasons using linear regression. It employs a custom gradient descent implementation for training, alongside the LinearRegression model from scikit-learn. The code involves loading historical data, preparing features, and making predictions based on various input parameters such as the season, minutes played, and matches played. The model is trained on historical data, and a specific season is tested to evaluate the predictive capability of the model."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "This project effectively demonstrated the application of a linear regression model to predict the number of goals scored by Kane during the 2012-2013 season, utilizing historical performance data from previous seasons. By systematically organizing data related to the season, minutes played, and matches played, we were able to establish a foundational model that captures the relationship between these variables and goal-scoring output. The model was trained using a robust dataset, allowing us to make informed predictions and providing valuable insights into Kane's scoring patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of our predictions indicate that the model can provide a reasonable estimate of a player's performance based on available data. However, to further enhance the model's predictive power and accuracy, I plan to incorporate additional variables that could significantly impact goal-scoring potential. Future enhancements will include metrics such as shots on target, assists, player age, and perhaps even contextual factors like the strength of the opposing team or match conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These additional variables can provide a richer dataset that better represents a player's performance and contributions on the field. By expanding the scope of our analysis, we aim to develop a more sophisticated model that can not only predict goals more accurately but also offer insights into the underlying factors that contribute to a player's success. Ultimately, this project serves as a stepping stone towards building a comprehensive analytical tool for evaluating player performance in football, with potential applications in scouting, coaching strategies, and fan engagement."
